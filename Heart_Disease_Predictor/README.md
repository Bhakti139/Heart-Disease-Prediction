# Heart-Disease-Prediction


This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on their clinical attributes.  
The aim is to build an accurate and interpretable model that can assist in **early detection** and **decision support** for healthcare professionals.


## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction and diagnosis play a crucial role in prevention and treatment.  
In this project, we:
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key risk factors.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- Train multiple machine learning models for prediction.
- Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes patient medical records with the following attributes:

- **Age**
- **Sex**
- **Chest Pain Type (cp)**
- **Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)**
- **Serum Cholesterol (chol)**
- **Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)**
- **Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg)**
- **Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)**
- **Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)**
- **ST Depression (oldpeak)**
- **Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)**
- **Number of Major Vessels (ca)**
- **Thalassemia (thal)**
- **Target (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)**

Models Used

We experimented with the following machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

XGBoost / Gradient Boosting (if applicable)

Each model was evaluated using:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Confusion Matrix

**Results**

The models were compared, and the best-performing model was selected based on recall and overall accuracy.
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 88.5% with balanced recall.

**Future Work**

Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.

Deployment of the model using Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit.

Integration with a healthcare dashboard for real-world use.

Testing on larger and more diverse datasets.
